# Simple Python Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly command-line calculator built using Python.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** using user input.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This was my **first Python project**, aimed at:
- Practicing basic syntax and I/O handling
- Understanding error handling with `try-except`
- Learning `match-case` (Python 3.10+)
- Getting comfortable with version control and uploading to GitHub

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you're using **Python 3.10+** (for match-case support)

```bash
python main.py
